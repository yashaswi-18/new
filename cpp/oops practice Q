Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members- length and breadth and a function to
calculate the area which is 'length*breadth'. The class has three constructors which are :
1 - having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.
2 - having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth
respectively.
3 - having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number.
Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters and print their
areas.

Suppose you have a Piggie Bank with an initial amount of $50 and you have to add some more
amount to it. Create a class 'AddAmount' with a data member named 'amount' with an initial value of
$50. Now make two constructors of this class as follows:
1 - without any parameter - no amount will be added to the Piggie Bank
2 - having a parameter which is the amount that will be added to the Piggie Bank
Create an object of the 'AddAmount' class and display the final amount in the Piggie Bank.

4.
Create a class named 'Programming'. While creating an object of the class, if nothing is passed to it,
then the message "I love programming languages" should be printed. If some String is passed to it,

All the banks operating in India are controlled by RBI. RBI has set a well defined guideline (e.g.
minimum interest rate, minimum balance allowed, maximum withdrawal limit etc) which all banks
must follow. For example, suppose RBI has set minimum interest rate applicable to a saving bank
account to be 4% annually; however, banks are free to use 4% interest rate or to set any rates above
it.

namely Customer, Account, RBI (Base Class) and few derived classes (SBI, ICICI, PNB etc). Assume
and implement required member variables and functions in each class.
